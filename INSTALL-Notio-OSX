2. Configure and build Golden Cheetah

Before opening the project with Qt, you'll need to copy the file

mentioned in the sections above.
   
In Qt Creator menu, go to Preferences... -> Build & Run.
Go in the General tab
 - Select Current Directory for the project directory.
 - Select Save all files before build.
 - Select Always build before deploying it.
 - Disable Always deploy project before running it.

Open the project.
 - Go in the Project section.
 - For each build configuration, disable the option Shadow build.
 - You can modify the Parallel jobs parameter, from the Build Steps section, to
   use the number of cores for the compilation process.
 - For each build configuration, add "/usr/local/bin" to the PATH variable in the
   Build Environment section.
   
You are now ready to build.

The build directory is the Bin folder in the main directory.

To be able to release an installer for Golden Cheetah, you must be in release
configuration. After building the project, do a Deploy All from the Build menu.

IMPORTANT: When switching from one configuration to another, execute "Run qmake"
========== from the Build menu. It will ensure that the environment will be in
           the right configuration.
