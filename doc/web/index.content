<em>To all those volunteers who selflessly give their time and without whom
amateur sport would not exist.</em>

GoldenCheetah is a software package that:

<ul>
<li>Downloads ride data directly from the CycleOps PowerTap and the SRM
PowerControl V, VI and VII.</p>

<li>Imports ride data downloaded with other programs, including TrainingPeaks
WKO+ and the manufacturers' software for the Ergomo, Garmin, Polar, PowerTap,
and SRM devices.<p>

<li>Provides a rich set of analysis tools, including a critical power graph,
BikeScore calculation, histogram analysis, a best interval finder, and a pedal
force versus pedal velocity chart, to name just a few.<p>

<li>Is available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.<p>

<li>Is released under an Open Source license.
</ul>

<p>
We believe that cyclists should be able to download their power data
to the computer of their choice, analyze it in whatever way they see fit, and
share their methods of analysis with others.
