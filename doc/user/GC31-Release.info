1 Whats New
***********

1.1 Major new features; Compare, Share and Merge
================================================

We have added a new feature to enable comparing rides and intervals
across all the charts where it is sensible to try; performance plot, cp
chart, histogram and QA charts all support compare.  Additionally it is
possible to compare trends across different seasons as well as
histograms.  And of course, these are also possible across athletes; so
you can compare one athletes season or ride with another athletes season
or ride.

Wherever it is sensible to compare things, we think it is now possible
to compare things.

We have also unified upload to "cloud" across Strava, RideWithGPS and
Cycling Analytics.  With a single click you can upload to all services.
We do not currently support Garmin Connect as they have closed their
system and only work with commercial partners - for this reason we
recommend storing data outside for future data security.

Lastly, it is now possible to merge data from different sources into a
single ridefile.  This is particularly useful when working with
multipled devices or integrating data from devices like the Moxy SM02
monitor.

1.2 General Enhancements
========================

We have made the following general / UI enhancements:

   * Open Athletes in Tabs - it is possible to open up all your athletes
     within a single window and switch tabs.

   * ChartBar - the chartbar has become a toolbar item and is
     scrollable.  This dramatically increases the screen estate
     available for displaying charts and data but also makes the UI less
     'quirky' and align more to typical desktop application styles.

   * Themes and better support for color customisation - we now have
     much more sophisticated support for color customisation and support
     across all the charts.  Themes allow you to switch between light on
     dark and dark on light setups quickly and easily.

   * Improved Interactivity - mouse over interactivity has been extended
     over the ride list and most charts for faster exploration of data
     and to provide a more fluid and dynamic user experience.  This
     extendes to isolating curves within a chart by hovering over the
     axis labels and automatically selecting intervals as you hover over
     their data in the QA and ride charts.

   * Autofilter in Trends view - as well as advance data filtering
     within chart setup and the toolbar search box we have now added
     autofilters in the trends sidebar to make it simple to filter data
     based upon metadata e.g.  all running files or rides on your TT
     bike.

   * Specify athlete library location - You can now specify where data
     is stored to make it easier to integrate with backup or other
     synchronisation tools.

   * Improved Dropbox support (CRC) - We will check the data within a
     ride has changed (as opposed to its timestamp) before refreshing
     metrics.  This is to remove unneccessary metric refreshes when
     copying data between computers or synchronising using tools like
     Dropbox.

   * Find intervals via matches, hills etc - The find intervals dialog
     will now find hills as well as sustained efforts using W'
     consumption (see support for W'bal).

1.3 Enhanced Device Support
===========================

We have fixed or enhanced device support for:

   * Fixed up Tacx Fortius Support - Dave Waterworth has updated the
     original beta code for Fortius support to now make the Fortius and
     fully supported device in train view.

   * Joule GPS updates - the latest firmware is now supported and no
     longer crashes GC (!).

   * FIT ride file updates - better support for custom FIT sections that
     are being used by vendors to suport localised data.

   * Pedal Smoothness / Torque Effectiveness support - the Rotor and
     Vector data series are now extracted and stored in ridefiles and
     can be plotted alongside all the other ride data series on
     performance, scatter and histogram plots.

   * Moxy support - we have added support for the Moxy SM02 monitor and
     can be imported and merged with ride data using the new merge
     dialog.

1.4 New Metrics Implemented
===========================

We have implemented a lot of new science in 3.1 and along with that
there are a lot of associated metrics:

   * Plot bests - It is now possible to plot user-defined durations for
     power bests.  For example it is now possible to plot 13s power
     best, but we have extended this to cover all ride data series, so
     you can plot best durations for heartrate, speed, cadence and so on
     within a metric trends chart.  This feature has been the most
     requested feature since LTM was implemeted in 2010, so we've
     finally got there.

   * Plot Model Estimates - With the new PD models we also derive
     estimates for W', CP et al using each of the models.  These can
     then be plotted; an example 'CP History' plot in the trends view is
     provide as an example.

   * W'bal implemented with metrics - The W'bal data series is derived
     from power data and can be plotted alongside all other ride data.
     It has also been implemented within the erg plot to assess ERG
     workouts before attempting them.

   * TISS implemented - An an Ae TISS have been implemented and can be
     plotted as data series within a ride but also as inputs into a PMC
     chart.  An example 'Stress' chart is provided to plot these in the
     Trends and Rides view.

   * aPower - We have implemented Altitude Power to adjust recorded
     power to take into account the effect of altitude on vo2max and
     thus power output.  This can be plotted alongside all other ride
     data series.

   * Polarised Zones - Histogram chart will now plot power histograms in
     Polarised Zones as well as the more familar Coggan 7 levels.

   * Pacing Index / Fatigue Index - Experimentally added to help review
     interval efforts.

   * W' work - To compliment W'bal and Work metrics we now isolate and
     can track how much W' energy is being expended.  This is closely
     related to tracking Anaerobic training.

   * Average Pedal Smoothness / Torque Efficiency - the Rotor/Vector
     metrics can be plotted alongside ride data but also as average
     metrics to track across weeks, months and seasons.

1.5 Chart Enhancements
======================

We have made significant changes across all the charts in 3.1.  These
have been added to support the new models and science and also to try
and enhance the utility and user experience.

   * LTM Chart - It is now possible to select charts via a Chart
     selection sidebar thus reducing the number of charts needed to be
     pre-configured on the chart bar.  We have also tidied up the LTM
     settings dialog and improved the UX for setting up charts in the
     first place.  To support the new compare mode we have also added a
     Stack mode and a Data table mode to look at series in isolation or
     just review the numbers.  It is also now possible to export the
     chart data to manipulate or analyse in other tools.  Lastly, we
     have also added Labels and Quadratic trend lines to create charts
     that are more readable without resorting to tooltips and guess
     work.

   * CP Chart - The critical power chart has seen a lot of new features
     added both to support the new PD models but also to provide the
     possibility to plot and compare intervals.  The key new features
     include User selectable CP models and the ability to fine tune the
     search intervals used by each of the 4 models.  It is also now
     possible to plot rates of change for power, heartrate etc and also
     to plot heat and heat by age.  You can also plot a ride as
     percentge of best or as a centile.  And as with the LTM charts it
     is also possible to export the PD data and model to review and
     assess in other tools.

   * Ride Chart - It is now possible to plot lots of derived series; NP,
     W'bal, xPower, Delta etc and also to plot each series in its own
     chart with all series shown as a 'stack'.  We have also finally
     added the ability to create and edit reference lines for power and
     have added an overlay to display interval data as you hover or
     select them in the plot.

   * Summary Chart - It is mostly unchanged but will now also support
     displaying user defined metrics for Athlete Bests for the date
     range selected.  It will also show model estimates that apply to
     the ride or for the date range being summarised.

1.6 Code refactoring and 300 issues fixed
=========================================

Since we release 3.0 in June 2013 we've been busily updating the code to
fix lots and lots of nits and errors, but also slowly adjusting the code
to provide a better platform for new features.

We have deferred almost all features related to indoor training to a
release 3.11 that is planned for the beginning of 2015 with development
starting in August 2014.

However, some of the (boring, tehcnical) foundational things that
changed in 3.1 include:

   * QT 5.3 is now supported; so QT video support, QML, Qt Json, faster
     webkit and for the future, possible support for IOS and Android
     devices.

   * QWT 6.1 with multiaxis is now supported; lots of bug fixes and
     better rendering on retina and high resolution displays.

   * CP chart and AllPlot chart refactored to make it possible to extend
     functionality e.g.  for new PD models and derived data series.

Some of the functionality that has been fixed include reinstated support
for Strava and Twitter.  We also have better native support for
look-and-feel differences across the three platforms we currently
support (Mac, Linux, Windows).

We have also adjusted the startup mechanism to make it possible to
select a different athlete or create a new one if recovering from a
fatal crash.
