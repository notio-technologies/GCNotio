Example for Timestamp is provided here:

----
ts,weightkg,fatkg,boneskg,musclekg,leankg,fatpercent,comment
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,Is a technically valid entry, but the timestamp is 1 second of Epoch
1479632565,80.15,12.10,5.4,0,32.5,1157,Test Value
1479632865,80.15,12.10,5.4,0,32.5,1157,"Here the comment text contain commas itself, so it needs quotes"

----
Example for Date/Time is provided here:

date,weightkg,fatkg,boneskg,musclekg,leankg,fatpercent,comment
2017-01-01T12:00:00Z,2,3,4,5,6,7,Useless data - but valid format
2017-01-02T12:00:00Z,80.15,12.10,5.4,0,32.5,1157,Test Value
2017-01-02T12:00:00Z,80.15,12.10,5.4,0,32.5,1157,"Here the comment text contain commas itself, so it needs quotes"


a) Header Line
First Line of a valid file has to contain header information. This has to be a comma-separated 
list of the measures provided in the data lines. You do not need to provide all possible measures,
but at least "ts" and "weightkg".

As mandatory field you need time/date of the measures. There are 2 options:
- "ts" 			- Unix timestamp (in seconds) since Epoch. The value can be calcuated in XLS - just Google how-to.
OR
- "date"		- ISO8601 formatted Date/Time String 

The mandatory measure is:
- "weightkg" 	- Athlete weight in kilograms

The optional measures are:
- "fatkg" 		- Fat mass in kg
- "boneskg" 	- Bone mass in kg
- "musclekg"	- Muscle mass in kg
- "leankg"		- Lean mass in kg
- "fatpercent"	- Fat percentage
- "comment"		- A description of the measures

Data formats:

- "ts" 		is a 64Bit Integer - any other time will be rejected
- "date"	is a ISO8601 formated date/time 
- "comment"	is a String - if it contains "commas" itself the string must be enclosed by "string with comma, and more comment"
- all other measures are float/double in format <xxxxxxx.yyy> 

There are very strict format checks when importing. Only if the whole
file is correct the data is imported. Any error (even in a single entry)
will block the complete import.

The following error will stop the import.
- Unknown measures in header
- Number of measures in header is different to number in an item
- Item measure in wrong format
- "ts" or "weightkg" is missing
