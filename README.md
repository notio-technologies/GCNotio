# GC Notio

## About 

GC Notio is a fork of GoldenCheetah which is an open-source data analysis tool primarily written in C++
with Qt for cyclists and triathletes with support for training as well. 

GoldenCheetah can connect with indoor trainers and cycling equipment such 
as cycling computers and power meters to import data. 

As the original GoldenCheetah, GC Notio can connect to cloud services including Notio and Legacy Notio Konect clouds. 

It can then manipulate and view the data, as well as analyze it.

This paticular fork allows to analyze the Notio device data to determine your CdA.
